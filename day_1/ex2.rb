# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.

puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run."

# I was right about the '#' character, and I now know that it is called an 'octophore', or a 'pound character'.

# Now I understand why you read code backwards - it helps your brain detach meaning from each
# piece of code, and allows you to process each peice of code individually to help catch errors.
