### Gear Up Prework

As mentioned in one of the readings, “empathy is the cornerstone of healthy human relationships”. Empathy has played a role in both my personal and professional life by allowing me to make deeper and more meaningful relationships with those around me.

It can be challenging to always be as empathetic as I should, and I know that that skill can easily wane when I feel under pressure or stressed. However, this is when I should be using this skill the most, as being empathic when part of a team can help cohesion and overall effectiveness – not to mention creating a more enjoyable working environment.

An Empathetic Design approach can most certainly help create better products and services, including software. Not only can an empathetic approach allow you to truly understand the end user and their habits, but this can also help to erase preconceived notions, identify opportunities not thought of before, and discover significant obstacles. Not surprisingly, companies who prioritize an Empathetic Design approach have outperformed their competitors.

The good news is that empathy is hard wired into all of us, and we can easily improve this skill simply by being more mindful, curious, and becoming fully engaged in listening to and learning about the experience of others.

This was a refreshing piece of prework!
