## ACTIVITY #1

### Acknowledge that micro-decisions matter.

As a detail oriented person, this trait strongly resonates with me, and it is good to know that there is value in stressing some small decisions. That being said, I will need to learn how to balance this trait with some of the converse ideas - while making sure not to get hung up on some details which may not matter as much, at the sake of speed and progress.

### Know when it’s time to give back

I was excited to see this behavior trait on the list, as one of the things that I have enjoyed the most in my current profession has been mentoring others and preparing them for their next role. Having a strong mentor can be an extremely valuable asset for someone who is new and learning - and it can be just as fulfilling to be on the other side, giving back and helping develop others. I hope to find myself again on both sides of this equation in my new career as a developer.

### Understand that “code is cheap.”

At this point as I am trying to learn coding, it can take a lot of time to write just a few lines. Even then, it can be hard to blow up the work and start from scratch. However, by remembering that "code is cheap", and keeping in mind that it can likely be more efficient to start anew rather than proceeding down the wrong path will help me have a good attitude about starting over and trying again, and help me write better code in the process.

## ACTIVITY #2
    
I am a big believer in using checklists. Having adopted this practice in both my personal and professional lives, I keep a running list of tasks and thought topics, in ranging levels of importance and time-sensitivity, in one form or another (white boards, scratch paper, legal pads). This has helped me stay on track and avoid "loose ends", and I have no doubt that I will use one daily during my time at Turing.

In the future as a full time developer, I imagine that checklists will continue to be a useful tool at many levels. Whether it is to keep track of the actual projects on my plate, or if it is a checklist to reference when testing code, checklists can have great value with any process.

## ACTIVITY #3
    
The Pairin Survey was interesting, although I don't know that I fully agree with the outcomes that I received. In fact, more than a few attributes here conflicted with what I know of myself, and feedback/results that I have received from other personality assessments and coaching. That being said...

Some of my strengths are being detail oriented and analytical - I don’t always take things at face value and often yearn to know more behind the scenes. In addition, I feel like I am a genuine and caring person, and I enjoy the opportunity to lead others when I can. As far as I how I know this - while not fully reflected in this particular assessment, these traits that I listed are consistent with other surveys, feedback, and reflection.

I work best when I feel empowered and supported while working towards an understood goal or vision. Clear expectations and a distraction free work setting always help to.

As far as greatest areas for improvement, one thing that comes to mind is managing stress better, and not letting the big picture or end goal overwhelm me. I can do this by understanding and controlling what I can control, and by breaking things down into pieces and tackling things one step/day/week at a time. In a more general context - I would like to become a little more independent and self-confident.

I think that my strengths can be applied to many fields, and this certainly includes programming. Detail oriented and analytical behaviors would seem to be valued here. In addition, I think that I could continue to use some of my soft skills in this industry, and that my want to help develop and lead others would be desirable as well. I have heard that programming is much more collaborative than many on the outside may think - and this is something that excites me.
